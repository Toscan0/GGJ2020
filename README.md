### Theme: 
Repair

### Description: 
Father and son cannot stand to be next to each other. Unfortunately, they have to work together fixing cars in their shops. And to top it all, they bought garages at low price with the caveat that they are separated by a highway. They must cross the highway back and forth to repair cars and earn money, while avoiding each other to not damage the relationship any further. Can car repairing help repair their relationship? Grab a friend and play together to find out.
